# Library

[Another Odin Project exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library).

This project is centered around learning how to implement OOP concepts in JavaScript.

## TO-DO:
1. ~~Set up HTML/CSS/JS skeleton files~~
2. ~~Add function to take user input and based on that input add a new book to a Books array.~~
3. ~~Add function to loop through array and display each book on the page.~~
4. ~~Add "NEW BOOK" button, which should pull up a form to fill its attributes~~
5. ~~Add button on each book's display to remove from library.~~
    - ~~Obviously this will require associating the particular DOM element with the particular book. A solution is to add a data-attribute with the array index.~~
6. ~~Add button on each book's display to change it's `read` status.~~
    - ~~This should be a method on the Book's prototype instance~~ (not sure why, but I made a setter anyway for practice)
7. **Extra Credit**: Use either LocalStorage or an online DB service (they recommend Firebase for this) to add persistence, so the data is preserved if the user leaves and comes back.
